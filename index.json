Such adverse impacts can be mediated by individual avoidance behaviors such as traveling from polluted cities to the cleaner ones. This study utilizes smartphone-based location data and instrumental variable (IV) regression to fill the gap of how air quality affects population mobility. Our results confirmed that air quality does affect the population outflows of cities. The increase of air quality index (AQI) by 100 points will cause a 49.60% increase in population outflows, and a rise of 1 µg/m3 of PM2.5 may cause a 0.47% rise in population outflows. Air pollution of former days can drive people to leave their cities three days or a week later by railway or by road. The effect is heterogeneous among workdays, weekends, and holidays.

Understanding the spatio-temporal characteristics of urban crowd flows is therefore of critical importance to traffic management and public safety, yet it is very challenging as it is affected by many complex factors, including spatial dependencies, temporal dependencies, and environmental conditions. In this research, we propose a novel matrix-computation-based method for modeling the morphological evolutionary patterns of urban crowd flows. The proposed methodology consists of four connected steps: (1) defining urban crowd levels, (2) deriving urban crowd regions, (3) quantifying their morphological changes, and (4) delineating the morphological evolution patterns. The proposed methodology integrates urban crowd visualization, identification, and correlation into a unified and efficient analytical framework. We validated the proposed methodology under both synthetic and real-world data scenarios using taxi mobility data in Wuhan, China as an example. Results confirm that the proposed methodology can enable city planners, municipal managers, and other stakeholders to identify and understand the gathering process of urban crowd flows in an informative and intuitive manner.

To address this problem, it is worth decomposing the mixed use. Inspired by the concept of spectral unmixing in remote sensing applications, this paper proposes a framework for mixed-use decomposition based on big geo-data. Mixed-use decomposition in terms of human activities differs from traditional land use research, and it is more reasonable to infer the actual urban function of land. The framework consists of four steps, namely temporal activity signature extraction, urban function base curve extraction, mixed-use decomposition, and result validation. First, the temporal activity signatures (TASs) of each zone are extracted as the proxy of human activity patterns. Second, the diurnal TASs of routine activities are extracted as urban function base curves (i.e. endmembers). Third, a linear decomposition model is used to decompose the mixed use and obtain multiple results (urban function composition, dynamic activity proportions, and the mixing index). Finally, result validation strategies are concluded. This framework offers method extensibility and has few requirements for the input data. It is validated by means of a case study of Beijing, based on a social media check-in dataset.

Understanding the intertwined usages of these three transit modes at different places and time allows for better sensing of urban mobility and the built environment. In this article, we leverage a comprehensive data collection of bus, metro, and taxicab ridership from Shenzhen, China to unveil the spatio-temporal interplay between different mass transit modes. To achieve this goal, we develop a novel spectral clustering framework that imposes spatio-temporal similarities between mass transit mode usage in urban space and differentiates urban spaces associated with distinct ridership patterns of mass transit modes. Five resulting categories of urban spaces are identified and interpreted with auxiliary knowledge of the city's metro network and land-use functionality. In general, different categorized urban spaces are associated with different accessibility levels (such as high-, medium-, and low-ranked) and different urban functionalities (such as residential, commercial, leisure-dominant, and home–work balanced). The results indicate that different mass transit modes cooperate or compete based on demographic and socioeconomic attributes of the underlying urban environments. Our proposed analytical framework provides a novel and effective way to explore the mass transit system and the functional heterogeneity in cities. It demonstrates great potential for assisting policymakers and municipal managers in optimizing public transportation facility allocation and city-wide daily commuting distribution.","tags":null,"title":"Understanding the interplay between bus, metro, and cab ridership dynamics in Shenzhen, China","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Liu Yang","Lun Wu","Yu Liu","Chaogui Kang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"a0c1fc9336ce99d24a75ac9a510a62f8","permalink":"https://cgkang.github.io/publication/ijgi-6110345/","publishdate":"2019-09-17T17:10:48.60693Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ijgi-6110345/","section":"publication","summary":"With millions of people traveling to unfamiliar cities to spend holidays, travel recommendation becomes necessary to assist tourists in planning their trips more efficiently. Serving as a prerequisite to travel recommender systems, understanding tourist behavior patterns is therefore of great importance. Recently, geo-tagged photos on social media platforms like Flickr have provided a rich data source that captures location histories of tourists and reflects their preferences. This article utilizes geo-tagged photos from Flickr to extract trajectories of tourists and then extends the concept of motifs from topological spaces, to temporal spaces and to semantic spaces, for detecting tourist mobility patterns. By representing trajectories in terms of three distinct types of travel motif and further using them to measure user similarity, typical tourist travel behavior patterns associated with distinct sightseeing tastes/preferences are identified and analyzed for tourism recommendation.

To leverage spatial interaction information contained in the above-mentioned massive data sets, we propose a novel unsupervised land use classification method with a new type of place signature. Based on the observation that spatial interaction patterns between places of two specific land uses are similar, the new place signature improves land use classification by trading off between aggregated temporal activity variations and detailed spatial interactions among places.

Previous studies which have aimed to quantify emissions from the transportation sector have been limited by either simulated or coarsely resolved traffic volume data. Emissions inventories form the basis of urban pollution models, therefore in this study, Global Positioning System (GPS) trajectory data from a taxi fleet of over 15,000 vehicles were analyzed with the aim of predicting air pollution emissions for Singapore. This novel approach enabled the quantification of instantaneous drive cycle parameters in high spatio-temporal resolution, which provided the basis for a microscopic emissions model. Carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and particulate matter (PM) emissions were thus estimated. Highly localized areas of elevated emissions levels were identified, with a spatio-temporal precision not possible with previously used methods for estimating emissions. Relatively higher emissions areas were mainly concentrated in a few districts that were the Singapore Downtown Core area, to the north of the central urban region and to the east of it. Daily emissions quantified for the total motor vehicle population of Singapore were found to be comparable to another emissions dataset. Results demonstrated that high-resolution spatio-temporal vehicle traces detected using GPS in large taxi fleets could be used to infer highly localized areas of elevated acceleration and air pollution emissions in cities, and may become a complement to traditional emission estimates, especially in emerging cities and countries where reliable fine-grained urban air quality data is not easily available. This is the first study of its kind to investigate measured microscopic vehicle movement in tandem with microscopic emissions modeling for a substantial study domain.","tags":["Air quality","Transportation","Emissions","Microscopic emissions model","Microscopic vehicle movement"],"title":"Predicting vehicular emissions in high spatial resolution using pervasively measured transportation data and microscopic emissions model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chaogui Kang","Kun Qin"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451606400,"objectID":"a4d14640703360d3795afc921e24a38d","permalink":"https://cgkang.github.io/publication/kang-201679/","publishdate":"2019-09-17T02:55:17.007766Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kang-201679/","section":"publication","summary":"Taxicabs play significant roles in public transport systems in large cities. To meet repetitive demands of daily intra-urban travels, cabdrivers acquire self-organized habitual operation behaviors in space and time, largely with assistance of their longitudinal operating experience. Recognizing those collective operation behavior patterns of taxicabs will enable us to better design and implement public transport services and urban development plan. In this paper, we systematically study patterns of the spatial supply of 6000+ taxicabs in Wuhan, China based on a monthly collection of their digital traces and the non-negative matrix factorization method. We successfully identify a set of high-level statistical features of the spatial operation behaviors of taxicabs in Wuhan, providing valuable insights to our knowledge of the demand and supply of taxicabs in (similar) large cities. First, we decouple several spatially cohesive regions with intensive internal taxicab travels (termed as demand regions), which intuitively reveal the well-known multi-sectored urban configuration of Wuhan. Second, by applying the non-negative matrix factorization to taxicab's longitudinal traces, we uncover remarkably self-organized operation patterns of cabdrivers in space (termed as supply regions) as reactions to the sectored distribution of daily travel behaviors. We find that a large proportion of cabdrivers frequently operate within single specific service area and a small proportion of taxicabs works as shifting tools between different service areas. Last, we focus on performances of taxicabs with distinct spatial operation behaviors and unveil their statistical characteristics in terms of frequency, duration and distance with passenger on board. Our work demonstrates the great potential to understand and improve urban mobility and public transport system from cabdrivers' collective intelligence.","tags":["Taxicab mobility","Travel demand-supply","Habitual operation behavior","Digital trace","Matrix factorization"],"title":"Understanding operation behaviors of taxicabs in cities by matrix factorization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chaogui Kang","Yu Liu","Diansheng Guo","Kun Qin"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"5142b3dd8a3327fb4b7f7f17a0aad645","permalink":"https://cgkang.github.io/publication/10-1371-journal-pone-0143500/","publishdate":"2019-09-17T17:05:29.588793Z","relpermalink":"/publication/10-1371-journal-pone-0143500/","section":"publication","summary":"We generalized the recently introduced “radiation model”, as an analog to the generalization of the classic “gravity model”, to consolidate its nature of universality for modeling diverse mobility systems.

Our study illustrates how cultural and linguistic diversity in developing regions (such as Ivory Coast) can present challenges to mobility models that perform well and were conceptualized in less culturally diverse regions.

Using a mobile phone call data set covering 4.39 million subscribers registered in a particular region, we construct two intercity mobile communication subnets and infer characteristics of the whole intercity mobile communication network of China. Results confirm that intercity communication intensity is characterized by the gravity model. The communication intensity based on mobile call number decreases along the distance with a scaling exponent 0.5, whereas the scaling exponent for the communication intensity based on mobile call duration is 0.4. Moreover, we uncover the rank-size distribution of tie strength (mobile call number and duration) between a city and its neighbours. The rank-size law of tie strengths between cities is mainly determined by the rank-size distribution of cities. The distance between cities plays a less decisive role than the size distribution in the network, but significantly impacts mobile communication patterns. The call duration of individual intercity mobile communication is generally positively correlated to the communication distance, explaining why the distance decay of communication intensity based on call durations is slower than that based on call numbers. The contribution of this research is twofold. First, we identify the distance decay effect in intercity mobile communications of China and uncover the dominant impact of the rank-size distribution of cities.

The direction distribution shows an NEE--SWW-dominant direction, and the distance distribution can be well fitted by an exponentially truncated power law, with the scaling exponent $β$ = 1.2 textpm 0.15. The observed patterns are attributed to the geographical heterogeneity of the study area, which makes the spatial distribution of trajectory stops to be non-uniform. We thus construct a model that integrates both the geographical heterogeneity and distance decay effect, to interpret the observed patterns. Our Monte Carlo simulation results closely match to the observed patterns and thus validate the proposed model. According to the proposed model, in a single-core urban area, the geographical heterogeneity and distance decay effect improve each other when influencing human mobility patterns. Geographical heterogeneity leads to a faster observed decay, and the distance decay effect makes the spatial distribution of trips more concentrated.","tags":null,"title":"Understanding intra-urban trip patterns from taxi trajectory data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chaogui Kang","Xiujun Ma","Daoqin Tong","Yu Liu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1325376000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1325376000,"objectID":"a02b06439fbef748317002ad232ccef2","permalink":"https://cgkang.github.io/publication/kang-20121702/","publishdate":"2019-09-17T14:34:50.310718Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kang-20121702/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper provides a new perspective on human motion with an investigation of whether and how patterns of human mobility inside cities are affected by two urban morphological characteristics: compactness and size. Mobile phone data have been collected in eight cities in Northeast China and used to extract individuals’ movement trajectories. The massive mobile phone data provides a wide coverage and detailed depiction of individuals’ movement in space and time. Considering that most individuals’ movement is limited within particular urban areas, boundaries of urban agglomerations are demarcated based on the spatial distribution of mobile phone base towers. Results indicate that the distribution of human’s intra-urban travel in general follows the exponential law. The exponents, however, vary from city to city and indicate the impact of city sizes and shapes. Individuals living in large or less compact cities generally need to travel farther on a daily basis, and vice versa. A Monte Carlo simulation analysis based on Levy flight is conducted to further examine and validate the relation between intra-urban human mobility and urban morphology.","tags":["Intra-urban human mobility","Urban morphology","Spatial heterogeneity constrained Levy flight model","Monte Carlo simulation"],"title":"Intra-urban human mobility patterns: An urban morphology perspective","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chaogui Kang","Yu Liu","Xiujun Ma","Lun Wu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1325376000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1325376000,"objectID":"f0430e220c40307eb4f159888150571f","permalink":"https://cgkang.github.io/publication/doi-10-1080-10630732-2012-715479/","publishdate":"2019-09-17T14:43:55.696171Z","relpermalink":"/publication/doi-10-1080-10630732-2012-715479/","section":"publication","summary":" Today, large-volume mobile phone call datasets are widely applied to investigate the spatio-temporal characteristics of human urban activity. This paper discusses several fundamental issues in estimating population distributions based on mobile call data. By adopting an individual-based call activity dataset that consists of nearly two million mobile subscribers who made over one hundred million communications over seven consecutive days, we explore the relationships among the Erlang values, the number of calls, and the number of active mobile subscribers. Then, the LandScan population density dataset is introduced to evaluate the process of estimating the population. The empirical findings indicate that: (1) Temporal variation exists in the relation between the Erlang values and the number of calls; (2) The number of calls is linearly proportional to the number of active mobile subscribers; (3) The proportion between the mobile subscribers and the actual total population varies in different areas, thus failing to represent the underlying population. Hence, the call activity reflects “activity intensity” rather than population distribution. The Erlang is a defective indicator of population distribution, whereas the number of calls serves as a better measure. This research provides an explicit clarification with respect to using call activity data for estimating population distribution.
